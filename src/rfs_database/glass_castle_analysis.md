Cohesion-Disengaged
Mother: Do you want me to make food that will be finished in a few hours, or do
you want me to finish this painting that will last forever?

Jeannette is hungry and seeks her mother's attention, but Rose is more focused on
her painting.

Cohesion-Disengaged
Daughter: I still don't understand why you followed us here.
Mother: We wanted to be a family again.
Daughter: We were never a family, Mom. We were a nightmare.
The phrase "We were never a family, Mom. We were a nightmare" is a bald on
record strategy, because it is spoken bluntly and without refinement. This statement
reflects a low level of cohesion (disengaged), because it shows a lack of emotional
attachment between Jeannette and her mother. This statement directly rejects her
mother's view that they can become a family again, while also emphasizing the
distance that has long existed in their
relationship. The sentence "We were never a family" is clear evidence of a threat to
her mother's face while also illustrating the weakness of their emotional bond. The
utterance is conveyed using the co-textual context.

Flexibility-Rigid
Daughter: I am moving to New York and there is nothing you can do about it.
Jeannette is feeling upset and angry with her father. She had always planned to go
to New York, but her father did not agree with it. Jeannette confirmed her decision
by saying, "I am moving to New York and there is nothing you can do about it". This
statement uses the bald on record strategy, as it is said directly without any
softening. This FTA reflects a rigid pattern of flexibility, meaning a decision that is
inflexible and leaves no room for compromise with her father. Jeannette asserts that
her decision is final, even though her father disagrees. The phrase "there is nothing
you can do about it" emphasizes her unwillingness to change and highlights the low
flexibility in their relationship. The context of this dialogue is situational, as it is
spoken in a tense and emotionally charged atmosphere.

Communication-Absence of openness
Daughter: Do you think Erma ever did anything to Dad.
Jeannette suspects that her father was abused by her grandmother.

Communication-Otoriter and lack of empathy
Father: "You can't marry that idiot, you're better than him"
Rex refused and criticized his daughter's decision.

Communication-Ineffective interaction
Daughter : Dad, we were just protecting ourselves. Erma was grabbing his…
Father : Shut up! I don't wanna hear another damn word about whatever did or

didn't happen!
Jeannette is trying to explain to her father about her grandmother's mistreatment of
Brian, but Rex responds with the sentence "Shut up! I don't wanna hear another
damn word about whatever did or didn't happen!". This sentence is a bald on record
strategy, because it is delivered directly and in a harsh tone. This FTA reflects the
dimension of communication, as it shows poor communication when Rex interrupts
the conversation and does not give Jeannette a chance to explain the situation. The
words “Shut up” and “I don't wanna hear” are forms of communication interruption
that lower the quality of family interaction by using co-textual context. This attitude
hinders problem-solving and reinforces dysfunctional communication patterns.
